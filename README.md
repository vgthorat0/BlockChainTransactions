[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

A console app in C# that receives some subset of transactions, and processes them in such a way that enables the program to answer questions about NFT ownership.


## Features

- Read JSON transaction data from user from inline or file.
- Maintain state of application and shows details about wallet ownership.

## Prerequisite
- .NET 6 SDK [Download][df1] (Required)
- IDE - VS Code [Download][df2] or VS 2022 Community Edition  [Download][df3] (Optional)

Download and install above prerequisite on you windows or macOS. Windows is prefered as it's tested on windows platform. 

## How to build and run
- Open powershell or command prompt on windows
- Extract/Checkout the project source code in C:\. You can change this directory but make sure you change path in following commands too.
- Run Unit test cases - This step is optional
```sh
    cd C:\BlockChainTransactions\
	
    dotnet test "BlockChain.UnitTest\BlockChain.UnitTest.csproj"
```

- Run below command to build application
```sh
  dotnet build "BlockChainEventStreamProcessor\Program.csproj"
```
- Open directory where output is generated
```sh
cd "BlockChainEventStreamProcessor\bin\Debug\net6.0"
```
- full path would be C:\BlockChainTransactions\BlockChainEventStreamProcessor\bin\Debug\net6.0 This path will have Program.exe generated after successful build.

- Once you in output directory run your test. 

Some of sample commands are as below. 
```sh
program --read-file C:\BlockChainTransactions\BlockChainEventStreamProcessor\transactions.json
program --nft 0xA000000000000000000000000000000000000000
program --nft 0xB000000000000000000000000000000000000000
program --nft 0xC000000000000000000000000000000000000000
program --nft 0xD000000000000000000000000000000000000000
program --read-inline '{ "Type": "Mint", "TokenId":"0xD000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "Address":"0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000" }'
program --nft 0xD000000000000000000000000000000000000000
program --wallet 0x3000000000000000000000000000000000000000
program â€”-reset
program --wallet 0x3000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
